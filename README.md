# todo-website

A todo list website; you can add, edit, and delete various lists.

You will want to update the secret and move it to an environment variable. A database is included, so you only need the create_all() line if you delete that database.

This is setup with Bootstrap, so it would be relatively easy to change the CSS for a sleeker look.
